 Limitations of GitHub Pages
• GitHub Pages is indeed a fantastic free service for hosting static websites, but it does come with some limitations to
keep in mind.
• Firstly, the static content size is limited to 1GB. This means you won't be able to upload large media files like videos
or extensive datasets directly to GitHub Pages. Additionally, there's a monthly bandwidth limit of 100GB. This
limit is quite generous for most small to medium-sized websites, but it's something to be aware of if your site
experiences high traffic.
• When deploying your website on GitHub Pages, keep in mind that the deployment process has a time limit of
10 minutes. If it takes longer than that, the deployment will timeout and may fail. Additionally, GitHub Pages
have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour, so you should avoid triggering deployments too frequently to stay within
this limit.

npm install  angular-cli-ghpages

ng build --output-path=dist --base-href="/your_repository_name/"
